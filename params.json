{"name":"GLsat","tagline":"3D satellite tracking and visualization utility written in  C++ using OpenGL","body":"<p>GLsat is a 3D satellite tracking and visualization utility written in \r\nC++ using OpenGL. This program takes satellite tracking information from\r\nNASA, calculates each satellites current position, and then displays their position around the earth.\r\nIt can track multiple satellites in real time and \r\nprovide detailed orbital information on specific satellites.</p>\r\n<p>GLsat was started as a project to learn OpenGL and practice\r\nscientific visualization techniques (real world modeling, translating\r\nFORTRAN to C++, maintaining mathematical precision, etc.).</p>\r\n<p>While not yet complete, GLsat is listed along with other similar software in the <a href=\"http://www.dmoz.org/Science/Astronomy/Amateur/Satellites/Tracking_Software/\">Open Directory Project</a>.</p>\r\n<p>In October, 2003 a presentation by Matthias Haupt titled <a href=\"https://exchange.esa.int/thermal-workshop/attachments/workshop2003/viewgraphs/tu-braunschweig/haupt/oss_engineering_sw.pdf\">\"Applicability of OSS to Space Thermal Engineering Open Source Software for Engineering Purposes\"</a> listed GLsat alongside other satellite tracking software at the <a href=\"https://exchange.esa.int/thermal-workshop/workshop17.php\">17th European Workshop on Thermal and ECLS Software</a>, sponsored by the <a href=\"http://www.esa.int/\">European Space Agency</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

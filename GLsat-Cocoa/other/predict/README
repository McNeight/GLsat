			PREDICT QUICK START GUIDE
			=========================

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================
This program requires ncurses version 4.2 or higher.  Earlier versions have
been known to cause segmentation faults and/or odd display colors with this
program.  ncurses may be obtained via anonymous FTP at:

	prep.ai.mit.edu

in the pub/gnu subdirectory

or:
	ftp.clark.net

in the pub/dickey/ncurses subdirectory.

The Linux pthreads library is also required.  Both of these libraries are
usually available in modern Linux distributions.


UNPACKING
=========
The PREDICT archive can be unpacked in any directory for which read access
is provided for all system users (such as /usr/src or /usr/local/src for
Slackware Linux).  As root, move the tar file to such a directory and
issue the command:

	tar xvfz predict-2.1.4.tar.gz

to unpack the file.


COMPILATION
===========
PREDICT's compilation and installation procedure differs slightly from
that of most software, but should easy enough to understand and follow.
First, move (cd) into the predict directory and execute the included
"configure" script by typing:

	./configure

as root on your command prompt.  This script compiles and runs the install
program that configures the source code for PREDICT.  It then compiles and
installs PREDICT by creating symbolic links between the executables created
in the installation directory and /usr/local/bin.


FIRST TIME USE
==============
First time users will be asked to enter their groundstation latitude in
decimal degrees NORTH (SOUTH may be entered as a negative), longitude in
decimal degrees WEST (0-360 degrees) (EAST may be entered as a negative),
and altitude in meters above mean sea level.  A recent set of Keplerian
orbital data for the satellites of interest and an accurately set system
clock are also required if successful real-time satellite tracking is
also desired.  Sources for such data include http://www.celestrak.com/
and http://www.amsat.org/.  (These sites also act as FTP servers
as well.)


FOR FURTHER INFORMATION
=======================
Please consult the files under the "docs" subdirectory for more
information on the use and capabilities of PREDICT.  The latest
news and information regarding PREDICT software is available at:

Happy Tracking!

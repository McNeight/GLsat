<P>
The perceived color of a material depends not only on the
light source but as well, of course, on the material's own
reflectance properties. As for a light source, a material's
reflectance properties (ambient, diffuse and specular) may
vary independently for each of the three primary colors
red, green and blue. In addition, a material's appearance
is determined by its shininess (which determines its
reflection of specular light) as well as its emmisiveness
(which is when it acts as a light source itself).</P>

<P>
The following example allows
you to set the ambient, diffuse, and specular intensities for each of 
the red, green, and blue reflectance components of the material. You can also
change shininess and emission.

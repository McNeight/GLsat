<P>Instead of perspective projection 
one could use orthographic projection
whose viewing volume is a rectangular box shown below.
In orthographic projection the objects in the box are 
projected toward the near clipping plane without forshortening of perspective projection.
To specify the viewing box we imagine that is is centered around the z axix and 
use

 <B><P>glOrtho(left, right, bottom, top, near, far);</P></B>
where (left,bottom,-near) and (right,top,-near) are the lower-left and upper-right 
corners of the near clipping plane, and (left,bottom,-far) and (right,top,-far) are the same 
respective corners of the far clipping plane.
 Both near and far can be positive or negative.

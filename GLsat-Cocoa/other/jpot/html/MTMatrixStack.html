</B></U></FONT><P>Each time a transformation command is executed OpenGL computes the corresponding 4x4 matrix M and updates the current modelview matrix C by C &lt;-- CM, so that objects rendered subsequently will be transformed by M as well.
At any moment the current modelview matrix C is actually the top element of a stack of matrices, and <B>glPushMatrix()</B> pushes into the stack a copy of its top element C. Once this is done we can later execute <B>glPopMatrix()</B>  to throw away the stack top element, most likely 
a current modelview matrix obtained from C by  additional transformations, and return to the situation just before the last glPushMatrix() when C was the current modelview matrix.
This way we can "isolate" the effect of transformations to within a pair of glPushMatrix() and 
glPopMatrix().<BR>
<BR>
Here is a concrete example. We have already studied that in the following code segment the first glTranslatef(0,0,3) affects both the teapot and the sphere.
<pre>
     glTranslatef(0,0,3);
     glutSolidTeapot(1.0);
     glTranslatef(3,0,0);
     glutSolidSphere(1.0,8,8);
</pre>
Let us compare this to the following code segment in which the first 
glTranslatef(0,0,3) is surrounded by a pair of glPushMatrix() and 
glPopMatrix(). (This code can be best understood using  the "Local Coordinate System Approach" discussed earlier.)
The effect of glTranslatef(0,0,3) is now limited to within that pair of stack commands,
and hence the sphere is no longer affected by this translation command.
<pre>
     glPushMatrix(); // memorize where the local coordinate system is
     glTranslatef(0,0,3); 
     glutSolidTeapot(1.0); 
     glPopMatrix(); // bring the local coordinate system back
                    // to where it was when we last pushed
     glTranslatef(3,0,0);
     glutSolidSphere(1.0,8,8);
</pre>

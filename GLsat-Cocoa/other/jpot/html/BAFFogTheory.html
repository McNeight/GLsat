</B></U></FONT><P>We can make our images more natural by adding fog, which makes objects fade into the distance. Fog is a general term that describes similar forms of atmospheric effects; it can be used to simulate haze, mist, smoke or pollution. When fog is enabled, objects that are farther away from the viewpoint begin to fade into the fog color. We can control the density of the fog that determines the rate at which objects faded as the distance increases, as well as the fog's color. For is applied after matrix transformations, lighting, and texturing are performed, so it affects transformed, lit, and textured objects. </P>
<B><U><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR="#ff0000"><P>Using Fog </P>
</B></U></FONT><P>Fog is easy to use. It is enabled by passing <B>GL_FOG</B> to <B>glEnable()</B> and then all we have to do is to choose the color of the fog and the equation that controls the density with <B>glFog*()</B>. Again a value for <B>GL_FOG_HINT</B> can be supplied as explained.</P></BODY>

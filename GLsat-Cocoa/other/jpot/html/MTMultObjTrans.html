<P>
In this experiment we examine the following code segment:
</P>
<OL>
glTranslatef(x1,y1,z1);<br>
glutSolidTeapot(1.0); <br>
glTranslatef(x2,y2,z2);<br>
glutSolidSphere(1.0,8,8);
</OL>
<P>
Since the effect of a transformation command 
applies to all subsequent transformation and rendering commands
(as seen in the previous experient),
the position of the teapot is affected by the first glTranslatef()
command only, while the position of the sphere is
determined by both glTranslatef() commands.
</P>
<A HREF="MultObjTrans.class">Click here</a> to run an example. 
Initially the code looks like 
<OL>
glTranslatef(0,0,0); <br>
glutSolidTeapot(1.0);<br>
glTranslatef(3,0,0);<br>
glutSolidSphere(1.0,8,8);<br>
</OL>
so the teapot appears at the origin and the sphere is located
3 units in the positive x direction.
Now try this:</P>
<P>- Change x1, y1, z1 of the first glTranslatef() to 2, 0, 4, respectively.
You see that both the teapot and the sphere are relocated, 
since the change affects both objects.
</P>
<P>- Now change x2, y2, z2 of the second glTranslatef() to any values you like. This affects only the sphere and changes its position relative to the teapot.
</P>

A viewing transformation "changes" the position and orientation of the camera
(viewpoint).
But it actually <I>does not</I> move the camera. The OpenGL camera is always stationed at the origin pointing
down the -z direction with its top pointing in the +y direction. So what do we mean by changing the
camera's position and orientation? Answer: we <I>simulate</I> the change by using modeling transformations.

Consider a simple case. We want to simulate
the camera being placed at co-ordinates (0,0,5),
ie, 5 units in the z direction, still pointing down the -z direction. Easy! Move the scene, that is the objects, 5 units in the
-z direction, which is just a translation, precisely glTranslatef(0.0, 0.0, -5.0). Generally,
it is not hard to see that the placement of the camera at an arbitrary point (eyex, eyey, eyez)
and pointing at (centerx, centery, centerz), which then is the "new" origin, may be simulated by a (scene) translation 
whose components are (centerx - eyex, centery - eyey, centerz - eyez) followed by a (scene) rotation
that lines up the vector whose components are (centerx - eyex, centery - eyey, centerz - eyez)
with the -z direction. Further, we may simulate a rotation of the camera about its line of sight,
if we so choose, by an additional rotation of the scene: apply to the scene the reverse rotation about the line of
sight to line up the direction of the top of the camera with its  original direction in the +y direction.

This simulation is exactly what is effected by the viewing transformation gluLookAt(eyex, eyey, eyez, centerx, centery, centerz, upx, upy, upz).
A note about the (upx, upy, upz) vector that specifies the direction of the top of the camera: the vector that is actually used as the
direction that the top of the camera is the projection of (upx, upy, upz) on the plane normal to the line of sight, ie., the
plane that is normal to the vector (centerx - eyex, centery - eyey, centerz - eyez).

 
</B></U></FONT><P>Viewing transformation can be done by using modeling transformation commands, that is, <B><I>glTranslate*() </B></I>and <B><I>glRotate*()</B></I>. We can think of
 the effect of these transformations as changing the camera position or as moving all the objects, relative to a stationary camera. </P>
<P>Using modeling transformation commands to emulate viewing transformation is similar to moving the viewpoint in a desired way while keeping the objects in the world 
stationary. Since the camera is initially located at the origin and since objects are often most easily constructed there as well, in general we have to perform some 
transformations so that the objects can be viewed. </P>
<P>This duality in the nature of viewing and modeling transformations is why you need to think about the effects of both types of transformations simultaneously.  
This is also why modeling and viewing transformations are combined into the modelview matrix before the transformations are applied.</P>

</B></U></FONT>
<P>Here are some example to have the same effect as <B><I>gluLookAt()</B></I> by using <B><I>glTranslate*()</B></I> and <B><I>glRotate*()</B></I>:</P>
<B><I><P>gluLookAt(0.0, 3.0, 5.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0)</B></I> is similar as using <B><I>glTranslatef(0, 0, -5);  glRotatef(45, 1, 0, 0);</P>
<P>gluLookAt(0.0, 5.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0) </B></I>is similar as using <B><I>glTranslatef(0, 0, -5);  glRotatef(45, 1, 0, 0);</P>
<P>gluLookAt(9.0, 0.0 , 5.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0)</B></I> is similar as using <B><I>glTranslatef(-3, 0, -10); glRotatef(45, 0, -1, 0);</P>

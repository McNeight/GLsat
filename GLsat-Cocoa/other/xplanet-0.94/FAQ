1) How do I get xplanet working with KDE2?

If you run xplanet from the command line, it looks like it kills the
"kdesktop" program for some reason.  The program Esetroot apparently
does the same thing.  You can use the -notrans option to keep xplanet
from killing kdesktop, but then you won't see the background since
kdesktop covers the real root window with its own big window.  To run
from the command line, you'll have to use the -window option for now.

Here's how to get xplanet working with kdesktop to display on the
background window:

      - Right-click on the desktop and select "Configure
        background..."  from the resulting menu.

      - On the "Background" tab, click on the pulldown list next to
        "Mode:" and select "Background Program".

      - Now click on the "Setup" button and then the "Add" button.
        Fill in the fields with the appropriate information.  My
        debian woody system already had an xplanet entry which looks
        like this:

	      Name             xplanet
	      Comment          XPlanet by Hari Nair
	      Command          xplanet --geometry %xx%y --output %f.jpg && mv %f.jpg %f
	      Preview cmd      xplanet --geometry %xx%y --output %f.jpg && mv %f.jpg %f
	      Executable       xplanet
	      Refresh time     10 minutes

      - Additional options to xplanet can be specified before the
        "&&".  If you want to turn labels or markers on I suggest
        creating PNG files instead of JPEG, otherwise the characters
        will appear blurry.
 
      - Now click on "Okay" to save the setup.  This allows KDE to use
	XPlanet to create a picture every ten minutes.

      - Finally, on the "Wallpaper" tab, select "No Wallpaper".  

2) How do I get rid of that silly smiley face?

Look at the marker file for the earth.  The last line reads

position=sun image=smile.png transparent={255,255,255}

Comment it out by putting a # at the beginning of the line.


3) I get errors compiling on a slackware system complaining about
Freetype.  What's wrong?

Slackware 8.0 comes with both freetype 1 and 2 headers.  Be sure that
the freetype 2 headers include flag
(e.g. -I/usr/local/include/freetype2) comes before the X11 headers.


4) How do I get cities to display their local times?

You'll have to edit the marker file and set the timezone keyword.  The
string containing the label needs to have format descriptors that can
be read by strftime.  The timezone keyword sets the TZ environment
variable.  See
http://www.gnu.org/manual/glibc-2.2.3/html_node/libc_427.html for a
description of strftime and
http://www.gnu.org/manual/glibc-2.2.3/html_node/libc_431.html for a
description of the TZ environment variable.

Here are a few examples:

On most Linux systems, this will display the hour, minute, and time
zone next to "New York":

40.70  -74.00 "New York %H:%M %Z"     timezone=America/New_York

Solaris ships with a smaller timezone database, so this should work on
either Solaris or Linux:

40.70  -74.00 "New York %H:%M %Z"     timezone=US/Eastern

Windows doesn't use the same timezone database, so you'll have to
supply the TZ variable yourself as a POSIX string:

40.70  -74.00 "New York %H:%M %Z" timezone=EST+5EDT,M4.1.0/2,M10.5.0/2


5) Can I display multiple planets?

Not directly.  I would like to add this at some point.  For now, you can
run xplanet twice, once saving an image file, and then using that
image file with the -background option.

Version 0.94 (released 21 Mar 2002)

	* Minor changes to allow compilation with Sun Workshop compiler.

	* Great arc files may now be placed in an "arcs" subdirectory.

	* Added the -mapbounds options.  Xplanet now works with maps that
	don't cover the whole globe.  This is useful if the user has a
	hi-res map and wants to display a small area.

	* Added the -print_coordinates option.  Xplanet will print out the
	observer's location and then exit.  This might be useful for
	satellite tracking, or getting the position of the sun or moon.

	* Added the -start_cloud and -stop_cloud options to xplanetbg.
	They are cloud images assumed to be at the start and end times of
	the run.  Intermediate cloud images are interpolated linearly.
	This only works if the -num_times option is also used.

	* Added the -specular_file option.  This adds the sunlight
	reflected off of the ocean. 
	
	* Set LC_NUMERIC to C so that satellite marker files get written
	properly for some locales.

	* Added the -spacing option to set spacing between great arc
	points.

	* Added the "symbolsize" option to the marker file.

	* Added the -hibernate and -idlewait options to xplanetbg.
	Contributed by Leif Van Horn.

Version 0.93 (released 22 Jan 2002)

	* Colors may be specified as hex values (e.g. 0xff = blue,
	0xff0000 = red)

	* Added timezone keyword to marker file.

	* Updated marker file for earth, added marker files in Chinese and
	Greek, contributed by Tomohiro Kubota.

Version 0.92 (released 2001 Dec 30)

	* Added locale support for label and markers, as well as marker
	file transliterations in Cyrillic, Japanese Katakana, and Korean
	Hangul, contributed by Tomohiro Kubota.  Additional
	transliterations should go into the appropriate subdirectories of
	$prefix/share/xplanet/markers/locale.

	* Added the -labelformat option.

Version 0.91 (released 2001 Dec 20)

	* Added the -labelrot option.
	
	* Added the -north option, contributed by Frank Solensky.
	
	* Modified tzcoord.pl as suggested by Marcus Harnish to output
	-lat -lon instead of -observer.  Removed the -observer option.

	* -transpng now takes an argument so that "-transpng filename"
	can be used instead of "-transpng -output filename"
	
	* Removed ImageMagick support.

	* An id of 0 in the satellite file will plot all satellites in the
	TLE file not otherwise specified in the satellite file,
	contributed by Marian Aldenhövel.

	* Added limb darkening in the orthographic and hemispherical
	projections.

	* Made some Makefile modifications.

Version 0.90 (released 2001 Oct 14)

        * Added -transpng option.

	* Added -sattrackid option.

	* Improved Saturn's shadow on the rings.  Added satellite
	tracking.

	* Created libannotate library.

	* Created libdisplay and libprojection libraries.

	* Created libsgp4sdp4 library based on sgp4sdp4-0.1 beta from
	Neoklis Kyriazis (http://leonardo.spidernet.net/Copernicus/22420)

	* Added support for multiple great arc files.  Started creating
	Satellite class.

Version 0.84 (released 2001 Aug 20)

	* Improved rendering of Saturn's rings.
	
	* Changed xplanetbg -command option to -prev_command and
	-post_command.

	* Added -labelname option.

	* Improved parsing of marker files.

	* Added --with-gl and --with-glut options to configure script.

Version 0.83 (released 2001 Jun 6)

	* Added Saturn's rings.

Version 0.82 (released 2001 May 02)

	* Added support for multiple marker files.

	* Started writing DisplayMacAqua class.

	* Made some changes to get Xplanet to compile on Darwin with X
	windows.

	* Added -fontsize option.

	* Added DisplayX11Base class for using FreeType fonts instead of
	X11 fonts if desired.

	* Added -markerbounds option.  Thanks to James Riley
	(James_Riley@bnz.co.nz) for the suggestion.

Version 0.81 (released 2001 Apr 03)

	* -mapdir and -fontdir are now searched first before any other
	directories.

	* Added -command option to xplanetbg.
	
	* Added "image", "position", and "transparent" keywords to marker
	file.

	* Replaced most of the char * variables by strings.
	
Version 0.80 (released 2001 Mar 16)

	* Added -xscreensaver option for compatibility with xscreensaver.

	* Added a fonts/ directory and helr____.ttf from the
	OpenOffice.org distribution.

	* Moved image and marker files into $(prefix)/share/xplanet/images
	and markers, respectively.

	* Added FreeType support for annotation in OUTPUT mode without
	ImageMagick.  Also added rgb.txt to the distribution for mapping
	colors to RGB values on non X11 systems.

	* Added "smart" placement of markers.

	* Changed -cloud_enhance to -cloud_gamma.

	* Wrote DisplayMagickpp class, which uses the Magick++ API to
	replace DisplayMagick.

	* Wrote DisplayMSWin class, which works with the Cygwin
	environment on Windows.  Thanks to Nigel Stewart for a lot of help
	with this.

	* Reorganized xroutines.cc into Display* classes.

	* Added -greatarcfile option.

	* Added -cloud_enhance option.

	* Added Peters projection, contributed by Martin Pool
	(mbp@linuxcare.com.au).
	
	* Added Ancient and Hemispherical projections, contributed by
	Richard Rognlie <rrognlie@gamerz.net>
	
Version 0.73 (released 2000 Aug 03)

	* Added -mapdir option.  When looking for an image, Xplanet will
	first look in the current directory, then the directory specified
	by -mapdir, and finally the prefix directory specified at
	configure time.

	* Added a tzcoord.pl manpage, written by Gopal Narayanan
	(gopal@debian.org).  Also closed some other bugs reported through
	debian as suggested by Gopal and Jay Treacy (treacy@debian.org),
	mostly where xplanet didn't deal gracefully with an unknown option
	or a file it can't find.

Version 0.72 (released 2000 Jul 16)

	* Smoothed out the seam at the 180 Longitude line in the SSEC
	cloud maps.
	
	* Added a patch from James Baughman to select the proper visual on
	an X display which has multiple visuals with the default depth and
	class.  Added some code to enhance the contrast of the SSEC cloud
	image.

Version 0.71 (released 2000 Jul 02)
	
	* Added -cloud_threshold option.

	* Added xp_getopt_long function.  This is a wrapper around the GNU
	getopt_long_only function.  I did this because the Sun and SGI C++
	compilers don't like getopt.h, but their C compilers accept it
	with no problem.

Version 0.70 (released 2000 Jun 26)

	* Improved GIF reader/writer.
	
	* Got x & y positioning with -geometry flag to work.  Added the
	-fullscreen option.
	
	* Created a new marker file for earth.  The old one was from
	xearth, which isn't under the GPL.

	* Added the other outer planets and Titan.

	* Added -cloud_ssec option.  This takes an image from
	http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/data/comp/latest_moll.gif, removes the
	pink continent lines, reprojects to rectangular and overlays onto
	the image.  GIF support works well enough for this but otherwise
	doesn't work too well.

	* Added ImageMagick 5.2.0 support.

	* Added Jupiter and the Galilean satellites.  The -body option now
	takes names instead of numbers.
	
	* Rewrote some labeling code I had lifted from xearth, which isn't
	under the GPL.

	* Added TIFF support.  Started adding other planets and
	satellites.

	* Added PNG support.  Added -terminator option, which places
	observer over the terminator and rotates the globe so that the
	terminator is vertical.  It's still off by a few degrees near
	solstice at mid-high latitudes.

	* Removed Imlib completely.  Xplanet now reads and writes JPEG and
	PNM files.

	* Started writing new image library to replace Imlib for reading
	and writing image files.

Version 0.60 (released 2000 May 09)

	* Added decompose_pixmap routine which can be used instead of
	Imlib_create_image_from_drawable.  Also added 8 bit PseudoColor
	support.
	
	* Added create_pixmap routine which can be used instead of
	Imlib_render.

	* Xplanet should compile with either ImageMagick 4.2.* or
	ImageMagick 5.1.1 (API changed between the two).  Added
	--with-magick option to configure script.  Compiling with
	ImageMagick is disabled by default.  Fixed animate mode to work
	with Mesa 3.1.

	* Added code to use ImageMagick library to write output file in
	case DISPLAY variable isn't set.

	* Added "color" and "font" keywords to marker file.

	* Added changes suggested by Daniel Martin to compute proper
	-rotate values when running xplanetbg in -orbit mode.  Also
	modified aclocal.m4 to link to -lGL and -lGLU instead of -lMesaGL
	and -lMesaGLU.

Version 0.50 (released 2000 Feb 22)

	* Made Xplanet more compatible with xearth: getopt_long_only is
	now used to parse options, so options may now be preceded by "-"
	as well as "--".  Added support for the "align" keyword in the
	marker file.  Changed --marker_file to --markerfile and --star_den
	to --starfreq.

	* Edited autoconf macros to add --disable-anim.  Xplanet will now
	build without OpenGL/Mesa/glut.  The --animate option will not
	work in this case.

	* Added ProjectionAzimuthal.class.  Also projections are now
	specified as an argument to --projection (i.e. --projection
	mercator instead of --mercator).

	* Added ProjectionMollweide class.

	* Added ProjectionMercator class.

	* Started restructuring the code - created Projection class and
	derived classes ProjectionRectangular and ProjectionOrthographic.
	This will allow the easy incorporation of new projections, like
	Mercator & Mollweide.  Also moved X & imlib dependent code into
	xroutines.cc, to ease porting to other windowing systems.

	* The "mercator" projection is actually a rectangular projection.
	All instances of "mercator", including the --mercator option, have
	been changed to "rectangular".

	* Modified options.cc and xplanetbg.cc to use getopt_long().

	* Fixed a bug in tkxplanet: changed --markerfile to --marker_file.

Version 0.45 (released 1999 Dec 29)

	* Added --nice option to xplanetbg.

	* Fixed a bug where --earthside didn't work properly for other
	planets.  Xplanet 0.44 released.

	* Sped up blending code a bit.

Version 0.43 (released 1999 Dec 06)

	* Fixed a bug where the --longitude option didn't work properly
	for the other planets.

	* Fixed a bug where labels & markers weren't appearing for
	--window or --output options.  Added --swap option to swap planes
	when writing image files on big endian machines, --notransparency
	option to disable updating the background pixmap for Eterms and
	aterms, and --localtime option.  --longitude option no longer
	implies --orthographic.
	
Version 0.42 (released 1999 Nov 22)

	* Added code to update background pixmaps for Eterms and aterms
	with transparency enabled.  Also generate icon pixmap for --window
	option.  Doesn't work with xplanetbg though.

	* Fixed a bug where markers weren't positioned properly if
	--center was specified.  Thanks to John Tillema for finding this.
	Xplanet 0.41 released.

Version 0.40 (released 1999 Oct 20)
	
	* Added --observer and --sunrel options.
	
	* Added --center option.

	* Cleaned up tkxplanet.
	
	* --demfile and --demscale work better now.

	* Changed all ftime() calls to gettimeofday().
	
	* KDE and GNOME default to putting icons in the upper left, so
	moved default label position to upper right.

	* Started writing tkxplanet.
	
	* Fixed a dangling pointer which caused xplanet to fail to render
	on some machines.

	* Started writing --demfile and --demscale options.

	* Allow background stars to have variable brightnesses.  Added
	--background option.

	* Added --num_times and --output options to xplanetbg.

	* Check if we're on a big-endian machine when using --output
	option.

Version 0.30 (released 1999 Jul 8)

	* Added listener for "delete window" when in --window mode.

	* Improved reading of marker files.

	* Added --body option for the moon.

	* Added --body option and parameters for Mercury, Venus, and Mars.
	Also added --color, --font, and --labelpos options.

	* Added the --timewarp option.

	* Added the --date option.
	
	* Rewrote the create_merc subroutine for better terminator
	shading.  Added --random option and Detlev Zundel's code for the
	--orbit option.

	* Modified configure script to look for OpenGL/Mesa.

Version 0.20 (released 1999 Jun 13)

	* Changed --ppmfile option to --output.

	* Added --marker option.  Can read markers from xearth files.

	* Added titles to windows. Renamed xplanetroot to xplanetbg.
	Added --label option.
	
	* Xplanet and xplanetroot can render into its own window, added
	--window and --geometry options.
	
	* Added --radius and --range options.

	* Moved parts of sunpos.cc into util.cc.  Added --moonside option.

	* Added --gridspace option, created autoconf files.

Version 0.11 (released 1999 May 18)

	* Added --rotate option, allows for rotation of the orthographic
	projection so that north isn't at top.

	* Fixed a bug in process_args: strlen(argv[i]+1) should have been
	strlen(argv[i]) + 1.  Thanks to Per Erik Stendahl and Larry Reeder
	for catching this.

	* Also added HP-UX flags in Makefile and made minor changes to
	allow compilation with HP's aCC compiler.  Thanks to James
	Baughman for this.

	* Added --blend option, like GL_LINEAR in OpenGL texture mapping.

	* Added --star_den parameter, adds random stars like xearth.

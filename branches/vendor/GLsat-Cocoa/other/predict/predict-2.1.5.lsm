Title:		PREDICT
Version:	2.1.5
Entered-date:	03JAN02
Description:	PREDICT is an easy to use, ncurses-based satellite
		tracking/orbital prediction program developed for the
		Linux operating system.  PREDICT permits users to track
		satellites in real-time, or make orbital predictions in
		advance of their arrival.  A unique voice mode allows
		azimuth and elevation bearings of a satellite to be
		articulated via a soundcard to aid a ground-based
		observer in locating and identifying satellites through
		optical means.  PREDICT also provides live bearings of
		the Sun and Moon, as well as solar illumination conditions
		onboard satellites.  Doppler shift and path loss information
		is also provided for analyzing radio communication paths
		between satellites and earth-based ground stations.
		PREDICT supports the PIC/TRACK automatic antenna tracking
		system, and includes a UDP socket-based interface that
		allows the program to provide real-time tracking data to
		any number of client applications running either locally
		or remotely via a network connection.  Several socket-based
		graphical satellite tracking display applications are
		included in this release of PREDICT.  PREDICT requires
		ncurses version 4.2 or higher and the pthreads library
		for successful compilation.
Keywords:	Satellite tracking, orbital prediction, amateur radio,
		astronomy, OSCAR satellites, Space Shuttle, ISS

<b>PREDICT</b> tracks and predicts passes of satellites
based on the geographical location of the ground station,
the current date and time as provided by the computer
system's clock, and Keplerian orbital data for the
satellites of interest to the ground station. First time
users of <b>PREDICT</b> are provided default ground station
location and orbital data information files. These files are
managed by the program, and are normally located in a user's
home directory under a hidden subdirectory named
<i>.predict</i>. First time users will be prompted to supply
<b>PREDICT</b> with their geographical location (the same as
selecting option <b>[G]</b> from the program's main menu)
the first time the program is run. Latitude is entered in
decimal degrees north. Latitudes south of the equator are
entered as negative numbers. Longitude is entered as decimal
degrees west. Eastern longitudes may be entered as negative
numbers. Station altitude is entered as the number of meters
the ground station is located above sea level. This
parameter is not very critical. If unsure, make a realistic
guess or simply enter 0. Users of <b>PREDICT</b> need
Keplerian orbital data for the satellites they wish to track
that is preferably no older than one month. The default
orbital data supplied with the program is liable to be quite
old, and so must be brought up to date if accurate results
are to be expected. This may be accomplished by selecting
option <b>[E]</b> from <b>PREDICT's</b> main menu and
manually entering Keplerian data for each satellite in the
program's database, or by selecting option <b>[U]</b> and
specifying a file containing recent 2-line Keplerian element
data sets that correspond to the satellites in the program's
database. Keplerian orbital data is available from a variety
of sources, including <A HREF="http://www.celestrak.com/">
http://www.celestrak.com/</A> and <A HREF="http://www.amsat.org/">

Orbital predictions are useful for determining in advance
when a satellite is expected to come within range of a
ground station. They can also be used to look back to
previous passes to help to confirm or identify past
observations. <b>PREDICT</b> includes two orbital prediction
modes to predict any pass above a ground station (main menu
option <b>[P]</b>), or list only those passes that might be
visible to a ground station through optical means (main menu
option <b>[V]</b>). In either mode, the user is asked to
select a satellite of interest from a menu, and then asked
to enter the date and time (in UTC) at which prediction
calculations should start. The current date and time may be
selected by default by entering nothing and hitting simply
the ENTER key when prompted to enter the starting date and
time. Otherwise, the starting date and time should be
entered in the form:
<P>
<i>DDMonYY HH:MM:SS</i>
<P>
Entering the
time is optional. If it is omitted, midnight (00:00:00) is
assumed. Once complete, orbital calculations are started and
prediction information is displayed on the screen. The date
and time in UTC, along with the satellite's elevation above
ground, azimuth heading, modulo 256 orbital phase,
sub-satellite point latitude and longitude, slant range
between the ground station and the satellite, and the
satellite's orbit number are all displayed. An asterisk (*)
displayed to the right of the orbit number means the
satellite is in sunlight at the date and time listed on the
line. A plus symbol (+) means the satellite is in sunlight
while the ground station is under the cover of darkness at
the time and date listed. Under good viewing conditions,
large satellites such as the International Space Station
(ISS), the US Space Shuttles, and Hubble Space Telescope,
and the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) are
visible to the naked eye. If no symbol appears to the right
of the orbit number, then the satellite is in the Earth's
shadow at the time and date listed, and is not receiving any
illumination from the sun. Pressing the <b>ENTER</b> key,
the '<b>Y</b>' key, or the space bar advances the orbital
predictions to a screen listing the next available passes.
Pressing the '<b>L</b>' key allows the currently displayed
screen plus any subsequent screens to be logged to a text
file in your current working directory. The name given to
this file is the name of the satellite plus a
&quot;.txt&quot; extension. Any slashes or spaces appearing
in the satellite name are replaced by the underscore (_)
symbol. The logging feature may be toggled on and off at any
time by pressing the '<b>L</b>' key. Exiting the orbital
prediction mode by pressing '<b>N</b>' or hitting the
<b>ESC</b>ape key will also close the log file. The log file
will be appended with additional information if additional
predictions are conducted for the same satellite with the
logging feature turned on. Selecting <b>[V]</b> from
<b>PREDICT's</b> main menu will permit a ground station to
only predict passes for satellites that are potentially
visible through optical means. Since all other passes are
filtered out in this mode, and since some satellites may
never arrive over a ground station when optical viewing
conditions are possible, the program provides the option of
breaking out of visual orbital prediction mode by pressing
the <b>[ESC]</b>ape key as calculations are made. A prompt
is displayed at the bottom of the screen to alert the user
of this option. In either orbital prediction mode,
predictions will not be attempted for satellites that can
never rise above the ground station's horizon, or for
satellites in geostationary orbits. If a satellite is in
range at the starting date and time specified,
<b>PREDICT</b> will adjust the starting date back in time
until the point of AOS so that the prediction screen
displays the first pass in its entirety from start to
finish.</td></table>

In addition to predicting satellite passes, <b>PREDICT</b>
allows satellites to be tracked singly in real-time using
<b>PREDICT's</b> Single Satellite Tracking Mode (main menu
option <b>[T]</b>), or simultaneously as a group of 24 using
the program's Multi-Satellite Tracking Mode (main menu
option <b>[M]</b>). The positions of the Sun and Moon are
also displayed when tracking satellites in real-time.
Selecting option <b>[T]</b> from <b>PREDICT's</b> main menu
places the program in Single Satellite Tracking Mode. The
user will be prompted to select the satellite of interest,
after which a screen will appear and display tracking
positions for the satellite selected. In Single Satellite
Tracking Mode, the current date and time are displayed along
with the satellite's sub-satellite point, its orbital
altitude in both kilometers and statute miles, the slant
range distance between the ground station and the satellite
in both kilometers and statute miles, the current azimuth
and elevation headings toward the satellite, the orbital
velocity of the satellite in both kilometers per hour and
statute miles per hour, the footprint of the satellite in
both kilometers and statute miles, the orbital phase of the
satellite in both modulo 256 and 360, as well as the current
orbit number. Additionally, if the satellite is currently in
range of the ground station, the amount of Doppler shift
experienced by the ground station receiving downlinks at 146
MHz and 435 MHz are displayed, as well as the one-way path
loss for these frequencies. The predicted time of LOS as
well as sunlight and visibility information are also
displayed at the bottom of the screen. If the satellite is
not in range, then the Doppler shift and path loss
calculations are not performed, and the next predicted AOS
date and time is shown at the bottom of the screen. If a
soundcard is present on your machine and the Single
Satellite Tracking Mode is invoked with an uppercase
'<b>T</b>' rather than a lowercase '<b>t</b>',
<b>PREDICT</b> will make periodic voice announcements
stating the satellite's tracking coordinates in real-time.
Announcements such as: <i>&quot;This is PREDICT. Satellite
is at 5 6 degrees azimuth and 4 5 degrees elevation, and
approaching.&quot;</i> are made at intervals that are a
function of how quickly the satellite is moving across the
sky. Announcements can occur as frequently as every 50
seconds for satellites in low earth orbits such as the
International Space Station (370 km), or as infrequently as
every 8 minutes for satellites in very high orbits, such as
the GE-2 geostationary satellite (35780 km). Voice
announcements are performed as background processes so as
not to interfere with tracking calculations as the
announcements are made. Announcements can be forced at any
time by pressing the '<b>T</b>' key in Single Satellite
Tracking Mode.</td></table>

Selecting <b>[M]</b> from <b>PREDICT's</b> main menu places
the program in a real-time multi-satellite tracking mode. In
this mode, all 24 satellites in the program's database are
tracked simultaneously along with the positions of the Sun
and Moon. Tracking data for the satellites is displayed in
two columns of 12 satellites each. The name, azimuth
heading, elevation, sub-satellite point latitude (in degrees
North) and longitude (in degrees West) positions are
provided, along with the slant range distance between the
satellite and the ground station (in kilometers). A letter
displayed to the right of the slant range indicates the
satellite's sunlight and eclipse conditions. If the
satellite is experiencing an eclipse period, an <b>N</b> is
displayed. If the satellite is in sunlight and the ground
station is under the cover of darkness, a <b>V</b> is
displayed to indicate the possibility that the satellite is
visible under the current conditions. If the satellite is in
sunlight while conditions at the ground station do not allow
the satellite to be seen, a <b>D</b> is displayed.
Satellites in range of the ground station are displayed in
<b>BOLD</b> lettering. The AOS dates and times for the next
three satellites predicted to come into range are displayed
on the bottom of the screen between the tracking coordinates
of the Sun and Moon. Predictions are not made for satellites
in geostationary orbits or for satellites so low in
inclination and/or altitude that they can never rise above
the horizon of the ground station.</td></table>

Selecting <b>[S]</b> from <b>PREDICT's</b> main menu will
allow solar illumination predictions to be made. These
predictions indicate how much sunlight a particular
satellite will receive in a 24 hour period. This information
is especially valuable to spacecraft designers and satellite
groundstation controllers who must monitor spacecraft power
budgets or thermal conditions on-board their spacecraft due
to sunlight and eclipse periods. It can even be used to
predict the optimum times for astronauts to perform
extra-vehicular activities in space. Solar illumination
predictions may be logged to a file in the same manner that
orbital predictions may be logged (by pressing
<b>L</b>).</td></table>

<i>xterm</i>, <i>Eterm</i>, <i>gnome-terminal</i>, or
<i>kvt</i>, and display <b>PREDICT</b> in a virtual terminal

<td width="10%"></td><td width="90%">
By default, <b>PREDICT</b> reads ground station location and
orbital data information from a pair of files located in the
user's home directory under a hidden subdirectory named
<i>.predict</i>. Ground station location information is held
in a file named <i>predict.qth</i>, while orbital data
information for 24 satellites is held in a file named
<i>predict.tle</i>. If we wish to run <b>PREDICT</b> using
data from alternate sources instead of these default files,
the names of such files may be passed to <b>PREDICT</b> on
the command line when the program is started. For example,
if we wish to read the TLE file <i>visual.tle</i> and the
QTH file <i>holiday.qth</i> rather than the default files,
we could start <b>PREDICT</b> and pass the names of these
alternate files to the program in the following manner:
<P>
<i>predict -t visual.tle -q holiday.qth</i>
<P>
or
<P>
<i>predict -q holiday.qth -t visual.tle</i>
<P>
If the files specified are not
located in the current working directory, then their
relative or absolute paths should also be specified along
with their names (<i>predict -t /home/kd2bd/orbs/visual.tle</i>).
It is also possible to specify only one alternate file while
using the default for the other. For example,
<P>
<i>predict -t visual.tle</i>
<P>
reads QTH information from the default
<i>~/.predict/predict.qth</i> location, and TLE information
from <i>visual.tle</i>, while
<P>
<i>predict -q bobs.qth</i>
<P>
reads QTH information from <i>bobs.qth</i> and TLE
information from the default <i>~/.predict/predict.tle</i>
location.</td></table>

It is also possible to update <b>PREDICT's</b> satellite
orbital database using another command line option that
updates the database from a NASA two-line element data set.
<b>PREDICT</b> then quietly exits without displaying
anything to the screen, thereby eliminating the need for
entering the program and selecting the appropriate menu
options. This option is invoked using the <i>-u</i> command
line switch as follows:
<P>
<i>predict -u orbs248.tle</i>
<P>
This example updates <b>PREDICT's</b> default orbital
database with the Keplerian elements found in the file
<i>orbs248.tle</i>. <b>PREDICT</b> may be updated from a
list of files as well:
<P>
<i>predict -u amateur.tle visual.tle weather.tle</i>
<P>
If an alternate datafile requires updating,
it may also be specified on the command line using the
<i>-t</i> switch as follows:
<P>
<i>predict -t oscar.tle -u amateur.tle</i>
<P>
This example updates the <i>oscar.tle</i>
orbital database with the two-line element data contained in
<i>amateur.tle</i>. These options permit the automatic
update of <b>PREDICT's</b> orbital data files using
Keplerian orbital data obtained through automatic means such
as FTP, HTTP, or pacsat satellite download. For example, the
following script can be used to update <b>PREDICT's</b>
orbital database via the Internet:
<P>
<tt>#!/bin/sh
<BR>
wget -qc www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/amateur.txt -O amateur.txt
<BR>
wget -qc www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/visual.txt -O visual.txt

wget -qc www.celestrak.com/NORAD/elements/weather.txt -O weather.txt
<BR>
/usr/local/bin/predict -u amateur.txt visual.txt weather.txt</tt>
<P>
To truly automate the process of updating
your orbital database, save the above commands to a file in
your home directory (such as <i>kepupdate</i>), and add the
following line to your crontab (type <i>crontab -e</i> to
edit your crontab):
<P>
<i>0 2 * * * kepupdate</i>

and <b>PREDICT</b> will automatically update its database
every day at 2:00 AM.</td></table>

The <i>-f</i> command-line option, when followed by a
satellite name or object number and starting date/time,
allows <b>PREDICT</b> to respond with satellite positional
information. This feature allows <b>PREDICT</b> to be
invoked within other applications that need to determine the
location of a satellite at a particular point in time, such
as the location of where a CCD camera image was taken by a
Pacsat satellite based on its timestamp. The information
produced includes the date/time in Unix format (the number
of seconds since midnight UTC on January 1, 1970), the
date/time in ASCII (UTC), the elevation of the satellite in
degrees, the azimuth heading of the satellite, the orbital
phase (modulo 256), the latitude (N) and longitude (W) of
the satellite's sub-satellite point at the time specified,
the slant range to the satellite in kilometers with respect
to the ground station's location, the orbit number, and the
spacecraft's sunlight visibility information. The date/time
must be specified in Unix format (number of seconds since
midnight UTC on January 1, 1970). If no starting or ending
time is specified, the current date/time is assumed and a
single line of output is produced. If a starting and ending
time are specified, a list of coordinates beginning at the
starting time/date and ending with the ending time/date will
be returned by the program with a one second resolution. If
the letter <i>m</i> is appended to the ending time/date,
then the data returned by the program will have a one minute
resolution. The <i>-o</i> option allows the program to write
the calculated data to an output file rather than directing
it to the standard output device if desired. The proper
syntax for this option is as follows:
<P>
<i>predict -f ISS 977446390 977446400 -o datafile</i>
<P>
A list of coordinates
starting at the current date/time and ending 10 seconds
later may be produced by the following command:
<P>
<i>predict -f ISS +10</i>
<P>
If a list of coordinates specifying the
position of the satellite every minute for the next 10
minutes is desired, the following command may be used:
<P>
<i>predict -f ISS +10m</i>
<P>
If a satellite name contains
spaces, then the entire name must be enclosed by
&quot;quotes&quot;. The <i>-p</i> option allows orbital
predictions for a single pass to be generated by
<b>PREDICT</b> via the command-line. For example:
<P>
<i>predict -p OSCAR-11 1003536767</i>
<P>
starts predictions for the
OSCAR-11 satellite at a Unix time of 1003536767 (Sat 20Oct01
00:12:47 UTC). If the starting date/time is omitted, the
current date/time is used. If a pass is already in progress
at the starting date/time specified, orbital predictions are
moved back to the beginning of AOS of the current pass, and
data for the entire pass from AOS to LOS is provided. When
either the <i>-f</i> or <i>-p</i> options are used,
<b>PREDICT</b> produces an output consisting of the
date/time in Unix format, the date and time in ASCII (UTC),
the elevation of the satellite in degrees, the azimuth of
the satellite in degrees, the orbital phase (modulo 256),
the latitude (N) and longitude (W) of the satellite's
sub-satellite point, the slant range to the satellite (in
kilometers), the orbit number, and the spacecraft's sunlight
visibility information. For example:
<P>
<tt>1003611710 Sat 20Oct01 21:01:50 11 6 164 51 72 1389 16669 *</tt>

<b>PREDICT's</b> network socket interface allows the program
to operate as a server capable of providing tracking data
and other information to client applications using the UDP
protocol. It is even possible to have the <b>PREDICT</b>
server and client applications running on separate machines
provided the clients are connected to the server through a
functioning network connection. The <i>-s</i> switch is used
to start <b>PREDICT</b> in server mode:
<P>
<i>predict -s</i>
<P>
By default, <b>PREDICT</b> uses socket port 1210 for
communicating with client applications. Therefore, the
following line needs to be added to the end your
<i>/etc/services</i> file:
<P>
<i>predict 1210/udp</i>
<P>
The port
number (1210) can be changed to something else if desired.
There is no need to recompile the program if it is changed.
To run more than one instance of <b>PREDICT</b> in server
mode on a single host, an alternate port must be specified
when invoking the additional instances of <b>PREDICT</b>.
This can be accomplished by using the <i>-n</i> switch:
<P>
<i>predict -n 1211 -t other_tle_file -s</i>
<P>
When invoked in
server mode, <b>PREDICT</b> immediately enters
Multi-Satellite Tracking Mode, and makes live tracking data
available to clients. Clients may poll <b>PREDICT</b> for
tracking data when the program is running in either the
Multi-Satellite or Single Satellite Tracking Mode. When in
Multi-Satellite Tracking mode, tracking data for any of the
24 satellites in the program's database may be accessed by
client applications. When in Single-Satellite Tracking mode,
only live tracking data for the single satellite being
tracked may be accessed. Either tracking mode may be ended
at any time. When this is done, <b>PREDICT</b> will return
the last calculated satellite tracking data until the
program is again put into a real-time tracking mode. This
allows the user to return to the main menu, and use other
features of the program without sending potentially harmful
data to client applications. The best way to write a client
application is to use the demonstration program (demo.c)
included in this distribution of <b>PREDICT</b> as a guide.
The sample program has comments to explain how each
component operates. It is useful to pipe the output of this
program through <i>less</i> to easily browse through the
data returned (<i>demo | less</i>). In operation, a
character array is filled with the command and arguments to
be sent to <b>PREDICT</b>. A socket connection is then
opened, the request is sent, a response is received, and the
socket connection is closed. The command and arguments are
in ASCII text format. Several excellent network client
applications are included in this release of <b>PREDICT</b>,
and may be found under the <i>predict/clients</i>
directory.</td></table>

One of the most frequently asked questions is how satellites
in <b>PREDICT's</b> orbital database may be added, modified,
or replaced. As it turns out, there are several ways in
which this can be done. Probably the easiest is to manually
edit your <i>~/.predict/predict.tle</i> file, and replace an
existing satellite's entry with 2-line Keplerian data for
the new satellite. If this method is chosen, however, just
make sure to include ONLY the two line data, and nothing
else. Another way is to is select the Keyboard Edit option
from the program's Main Menu, select a satellite you wish to
replace. Edit the name and object number (replacing the old
information with the new information). Just hit ENTER, and
accept all the other orbital parameters shown. Get back to
<b>PREDICT's</b> Main Menu. Select Auto Update, and then
enter the filename containing the 2-line element data for
your favorite new satellite. The new satellite data should
be detected by <b>PREDICT</b>, and the orbital data for the
old satellite will be overwritten by the new
data.</td></table>

In addition to tracking and predicting passes of satellites,
<b>PREDICT</b> may also be used to generate a NASA two-line
Keplerian element data set from data entered via keyboard.
For example, let's say you're listening to Space Shuttle
audio re-broadcasts via WA3NAN and Keplerian elements for
the Space Shuttle's orbit are given by the announcer. The
orbital data provided by WA3NAN in verbal form may be
manually entered into <b>PREDICT's</b> orbital database
using option <b>[E]</b> of the program's main menu (Keyboard
Edit of Orbital Database). The orbital data for the Space
Shuttle in NASA two-line element form can then be found in
your orbital database file, and may imported to any other
satellite tracking program that accepts two-line element
files or distributed to others electronically. It is also
possible to run <b>PREDICT</b> as a background process and
direct its display to an unused virtual console by using the
following command: <i>predict &lt; /dev/tty8 &gt; /dev/tty8
&amp;</i> Switching to virtual console number 8 (ALT-F8 in
text mode) will allow <b>PREDICT</b> to be controlled and
displayed even after you've logged out. This is especially
handy when running <b>PREDICT</b> in server mode on a remote
machine.</td></table>

The motion of a satellite in its orbit around the earth, and

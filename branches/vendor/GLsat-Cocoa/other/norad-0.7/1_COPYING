Copyright Information:

The C sourcecode in the file norad.c was ported partly form NORAD's
Spacetrack report #3, which included FORTRAN source for SGP, SGP4, 
SDP4, SGP8 and SDP8. According to a statement in that report, the 
document is free of copyrights and open to unlimited public distribution.

Some parts of the C sourcecode in  the file norad.c were ported from
Pascal code provided by Dr. TS. Kelso on his CelesTrack website at
http://celestrack.com/ . I have reproduced the copyright information
regarding the Pascal source I used below:

{           Author:  Dr TS Kelso }
{ Original Version:  1991 Oct 30}
{ Current Revision:  1992 Sep 03}
{          Version:  1.50 }
{        Copyright:  1991-1992, All Rights Reserved }

I make no copyright claims to the C ports in norad.c as I used the above
material downloaded from the Internet to produce it. I suppose any
sourcecode used from norad.c must contain the above copyright statement
by Dr. TS. Kelso.

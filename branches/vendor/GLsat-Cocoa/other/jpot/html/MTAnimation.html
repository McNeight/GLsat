</B></U></FONT><P>OpenGL provides single and double-buffering. For single buffering a frame is calculated to draw then viewed when completed. For double buffering one frame is displayed while the other is drawn. When the drawing of a frame is complete, the two buffers are swapped, so the one that was being viewed is now used for drawing, and vice versa.</P>
<P>We initialize single buffering by calling <B>glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_SINGLE….) </B>routine, and double buffering by a call to <B>glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_DOUBLE......)</B> in the main function. We swap buffers to create an animation by calling <B>glutSwapBuffers()</B> routine in our <B>display()</B> function. To see how the animation would be different when using single buffering and double buffering, check out the examples. </P>

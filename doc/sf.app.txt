GLsat is a 3D satellite tracking and visualization utility written in C++ 
and using OpenGL. It can track multiple satellites in real time and 
provide detailed orbital information on specific satellites. 

It is currently developed on Linux using various GNU utilities, however 
the code should be fairly platform independent and easily ported to other 
Unix systems or even Windows 98/2000/XP.

Currently, I have a working version of the software, but it is still alpha 
quality at best. The project was originally intended for me to apply what 
I've learned about C++ programming as well as allow me to experiment with 
OpenGL and scientific visualization. However, it seems that there is no 
other program quite like it (short of xplanet, which does too much), and 
after using free software for so long I wish to give something back. It's 
not much, yet, but like all projects perhaps it will take on a life of 
it's own.

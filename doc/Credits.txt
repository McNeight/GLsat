Prior Art (and Thanks)
======================

* North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD)
  For designing and implementing the original mathematical models used
  for satellite orbit prediction.

* T.S. Kelso <TSKelso@celestrak.com>
  For making the original NORAD Spacetrack Report Number 3 publically
  available on the Internet. Details in the document helped me to
  interpret what the code was *really* trying to do, and assisted me in
  applying human-readable variable names.

* Neoklis Kyriazis  <neoklis@my-deja.com>
  I am most grateful to his implementation, as he has eliminated the
  goto's that were woven throught the original FORTRAN code and
  generally brought the code up to the level of a true C program.

* Varol Okan <varol.okan@MovingSatellites.com>
  Although his site does not specifically state whether or not his code
  is GPL'ed, I believe that since it is based upon the work of Dr. Kelso
  and the source code is publicly available, it is reasonable to believe
  that it is GPL. A 'COPYING' file included with his source code would
  greatly clarify this.

* Sergey Klibanov and Mike Rodehorst from UofM ACM SIGGRAPH
  For attempting to teach me OpenGL. I wish I could have spent more
  time on the whole series of classes, but what I got seems to be
  enough to get myself in trouble, at least.

* Professor Jon Harris
  For teaching me more about computer graphics than I ever hoped to
  know. If this program has any cool tricks or features that really
  stand out, it's because of his guidance.

* NASA J-Track 3D
  http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/RealTime/JTrack/3D/JTrack3D.html
  Nice. That is the interface that I am aiming for. Perhaps more
  information can be displayed, but it's click-and-rotate-the-galaxy
  method is what I had in mind before I saw this applet.

Since my work is not a derivative of any of the above works, I don't
believe that there is any copyright conflict. I claim that my
implementation is directly derived from the public domain algorithms
and FORTRAN source code listed in NORAD Spacetrack Report Number 3.
However, I admit to looking at the source from all of the above listed
projects for advice and hints.

I release my source code under the GNU General Public License, version 2,
but retain the copyright for myself. All rights reserved.


References
==========

I wish I could rank these books in order of importance, but it truly
is impossible. Each book has contributed something, and no one piece
played a greater role over the other.

* 'Astronomical Formulae for Calculators' by Jean Meeus
  Fourth Edition
  ISBN 0-943396-22-0

* 'Practical Astronomy with your Calculator' by Peter Duffett-Smith
  Third Edition
  ISBN 0-521-35699-7

lots of books

* The soundtrack to the movie 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?'
  I really can't explain it. I finally saw the movie on March 2nd, 2002.
  Not long after, I realized I couldn't get "I'll Fly Away" out of my
  head, so I bought the soundtrack and I've been listening to it almost
  every day since.

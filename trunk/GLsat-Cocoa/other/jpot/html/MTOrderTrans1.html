<P>
There are two approaches to "interpret" a sequence of 
modeling transformations.
Consider the following code segment, where drawcube() is a function to
draw a cube at the origin.

glTranslatef(3.0, 0.0, 0.0);<br>
glRotatef(90, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0);<br>
glTranslatef(6.0, 0.0, 0.0); <br>
drawcube();

<LI><font color="#ff0000">The Fixed Coordinate System Approach (the top window):</font>
<P> A cube is drawn at the origin, and then transformations are 
applied in the reverse order, all with respect to the fixed,
global coordinate system.  That is, the cube drawn at the origin of 
the global coordinate system is first translated by 6.0 in the positive x direction, 
then rotated by 90 degrees about the y axis of the global coordinate 
system, and finally translated by 3.0 
in the positive x direction of of the global coordinate system.

<LI><font color="#ff0000">Local Coordinate System Approach (the bottom window):</font>
<P>
Transformations are applied
to a local coordinate system (shown in cyan)
in the order they appear in the code, and then a cube is drawn at the origin
of that coordinate system.
All transformations take place in terms of
the "floating" local coordinate system. 
In our example,
the local coordinate system is first translated by 3.0 
in its positive x direction, 
then rotated by 90 degrees about its y axis, 
and finally translated by 3.0 in its positive x direction (which now coincides with the negative z direction of the global coordinate system). 
The drawcube() command then renders a cube at the origin of the local coordinate system.

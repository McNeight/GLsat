Just as light has color, determined by the proportions of the three
primary color types, so does it have reflectance properties, again of three
types: ambient, diffuse, and specular. </P>
<P>
The following example allows
you to set the ambient, diffuse, and specular intensities for each of 
the red, green, and blue components of one light source. You can also
position this light source. The light source position is indicated by
a white sphere.

The following changes were made by John A. Magliacane, KD2BD in this release
of "map":

* The program no longer requires a map.cfg file under ~/.predict containing
  the local timezone offset.  Timezone offsets are now read directly from the
  system clock.

* AOS date/time has now been changed to "Next Event Time" and centered
  in the display window.

* "map" now correctly reads the new response from the GET_LIST socket
  command.  Starting with PREDICT version 2.1.3, the GET_LIST command
  now sends the entire list of satellite names in PREDICT's database
  as a single string and must be parsed by the client.  In earlier
  versions, GET_LIST returned only one satellite name at a time, and
  had to be called 24 times to receive the entire list of names.

* "map" now issues an error message if it is invoked without a system name
  (such as localhost, if running on the same machine as PREDICT) instead of
  crashing.

* The window border title was changed to read, "map: Real-Time Satellite
  Tracking Display".
   
* A "build" script was added to compile the program.

WELCOME TO GSAT!

gsat is a satellite tracking program. It is a graphical frontend to the predict orbital prediction program by John Magliacane KD2BD.

To install, do the usual:

	./configure
	./make
	./make install

Make sure to have predict installed and the predict service configured in the /etc/services.
Define the host with the predict server by:

	export PREDICTHOST=<hostname>


where <hostname> is the host name of the server.
Then execute gsat by typing:

	gsat

or by using -s option, like:

	gsat -s hostname

where hostname is the host name of the server.
If no PREDICTHOST variable or no -s option are used, localhost is assumed.

From gsat version 0.9.0, you have to use the connect button to make a connection to a predict server.

ABOUT PLUGINS

gsat can do automatic doppler correction via plugins. Plugins must be placed in the /usr/local/lib/gsat/plugins directory or in a directory pointed to by the GSATPLUGINSDIR environment variable. Plugin's name must begin by "plugin_". Once you have the plugins installed, you can select it in the preferences window, pass it a config string and activate it in the doppler section of the main window.
There is a file called Plugin_API with the info to program a custom plugin. There are some examples in the plugins subdir.

Happy tracking !!!

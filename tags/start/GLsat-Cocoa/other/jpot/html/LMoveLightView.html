</B></U></FONT><P>To create a light that moves along with the viewpoint you need to set the light position <B>before</B> the viewing transformation. Then the viewing transformation affects both the light and the viewpoint in the same manner. 
</P>
<P>
The example shows the torus of the experiment with a moving light source, <B>except</B>
that now the view point and the light source are both located at a location that
travels around the torus (we dont see the cube any more because the eye is located at it).
The left mouse button starts the animation. Observe how the visible portion of the torus
is always lit.</P>

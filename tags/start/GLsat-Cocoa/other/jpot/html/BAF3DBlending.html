</B></U></FONT><P>This example shows how the order in which objects are rendered effects blending. All three objects in the scene are stationary. The farthest is the back box, next the cyan box, and finally the red sphere is closest to the viewpoint. </P>
<P>
In addition to being able to change the alpha values of the three objects independently
you can also specify the order in which they are rendered (which is simply the order
that the objects appear in the display routine), either
<OL> 
<LI> Black box (first), cyan box, sphere, or
<LI> Sphere, cyan box, black box.
</OL>

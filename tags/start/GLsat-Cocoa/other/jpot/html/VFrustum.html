</B></U></FONT><P>The viewing frustum is a truncated pyramid whose top has been cut off by a plane parallel to its base. The apex of this pyramid is at the origin. The four sides of the frustum, its top and its base define the six clipping planes of the viewing volume.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="frustum.gif" WIDTH=478 HEIGHT=212></P>
<P>Objects or parts of objects outside these planes are clipped from the final image. The perspective viewing volume is specified using the following function:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<B><I><P>glFrustum(left, right, bottom, top, near, far);</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</B></I><P>This creates a matrix that accomplishes perspective projection and multiplies the current projection matrix (typically the identity matrix) by it. The frustum's viewing volume is defined by the parameters : (left, bottom, -near) and (right, top -near) specify the (x,y,z) coordinates of the lower-left and upper-right corners of the near clipping plane; near and far give the distances from the viewpoint to the near and far clipping planes. Both near and far should be positive.</P></BODY>
